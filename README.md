Misc scripts for working with Verus Coin

See comments at the top of each script for usage information.

Simple staker shields coinbases to a private address, then moves available private address balances to public addresses (randomly selected from those available, creating new addresses if necessary) for staking. This script can be run manually, set up as a cron job, or used with the blocknotify parameter to execute every X blocks.
